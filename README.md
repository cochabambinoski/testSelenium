## Project Object Model

The design pattern used for this project was POM, and since its architecture divides the pages in classes, we try to ensure that we wont duplicate code, variables and locators can be called from anywhere and structure will be cleaner.

## Explanation of the project

Basically I have created the project with the design pattern mentioned before but I didnt create a folder for an specific functionality, neither dividing the pages, locators and external elements. All this due this is a short project.

I divided the project in 2 folders, the first one to encapsulate the pages and its probably tests for it. The second one was only to order the tests, and run them all in a simple class with JUnit and Selenium.

If you run it, you clearly will see how the test can pass or can fail.
